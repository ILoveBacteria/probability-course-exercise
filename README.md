# Probability Course Exercise

## Description

This GitHub repo contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores some interesting topics in probability and statistics. 

The notebook compares the **binomial** and **hypergeometric** distributions, which are both discrete probability distributions that
model the number of successes in a fixed number of trials. 

The notebook also analyses **Zipf's** law, which is an empirical law that states that the frequency of a word in a text is inversely proportional to its rank. 
The notebook uses a sample text from a book to demonstrate Zipf's law and plot the frequency-rank distribution. 

Furthermore, the notebook analyses **Benford's** law, which is another empirical law that states that the leading digits of many real-life numbers follow a certain distribution. 
The notebook uses _SciPy_ constants and random networks to generate numbers that follow Benford's law and plot the digit distribution. 

Finally, the notebook finds the best **fits** of _Weibull_, _log-normal_, and _Pareto_ distributions to Benford's distribution.
